To be brief, functional programming is about functions.
With PHP, we can do functional programming for instance with callable functions and arrays.

Let's go !

Write a program that prints the text "Hello World" to the console with a callable function.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

You can use "echo" to print a text.

A callable function in PHP can be used as that :

```php
$var = function() {
   echo "First test !";
};

$var();
```

Documentation on the `Callable function` can be found by pointing your browser here:
